                            <h3 class="h2 mb-4">About</h3>
                            <p>During my senior year at Stony Brook University, I was the website intern for the university's College of Business.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the past, I designed and published websites as a part of extracurricular activities. However, this was the first time I published changes on a website that was being used and viewed by a larger audience. It was an experience that allowed me to gain knowledge and professional experience with working on a website. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One of my main tasks for this internship was working on the website and improving its design. I researched, planned, and gathered elements from various sources to create a seamless final product. I used Adobe Photoshop and Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype for the website.

                </div>
                        
                         <div class="row gx-5 align-items-center">
                            <div class="mt-5">
                            <div class="mb-2"><i class="bi-chat-center fs-1 text-primary"></i></div>
                            <h3 class="h2 mb-4">Research</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p>To find ways to improve our website design, I had to research what layouts were popular and what suited our purpose best. I compiled a list of other AAU (Association of American University) business schools and explored their website architecture.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I created a presentation on their website layout, the navigation bar, and the subheadings under each category. Having a list of examples made it easier for me to determine which areas of the website needed improvement. </p>
                        </div>
                </div>
                        
                         <div class="mt-5">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-research.png" alt="..." />
                             
                             <p> <br>
                                 <br>I used <strong>OmniCMS</strong> as the primary tool for working on the website. By adhering to the University design guidelines, I used the OmniCMS platform to experiment with the different web elements I could use. 
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 I made a list of suggestions to improve the website, however, not every change that I suggested could be implemented on the website, because we were limited by the capabilities of the system. With more research and experimentation, I found similar alternatives.</p>
                        </div>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>One of the improvements I suggested was adding new media to the webpage. I noticed the websites of other universities featured large banners, slideshows or immersive videos on their landing page.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I used Photoshop to create hero images to highlight different faces in the College, such as guest speakers, and student leaders (see left). This allowed for a more interesting experience for website visitors, as the new composition of elements propelled a dynamic flow. </p>

                            <p><br>
                            <br>
                            I wanted the website to show what our university has to offer by using the tool of photography. Although I was given access to a university-wide database of stock images, I opted for taking new photographs to enhance the website instead of relying on pre-existing ones. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                 I prioritized quality over quantity in photos, to accurately represent our student body and help communicate the values and message of the College of Business to website visitors.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                               To the right and below are some of the photos that I took, displaying meaningful interactions between faculty, staff, and students.
                            </p>

                    </div>
                            
                            <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-1">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-photos-1.png" alt="..." />
                </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-2">
                            <p>I prioritized getting vibrant, high quality photos as one of the components for designing the website. Photography can help to create a visually appealing and attractive page. Prospective students who view the website will be impressed with its visual appearance and be more interested in the programs.         
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                                Overall, the photographs I took helped to make the website more engaging, memorable, and effective at conveying the College of Business’ message to visitors.

                            <br>
                            <p>Since I was responsible for photographing College of Business events on campus, I attended seminars and meetings hosted by faculty and professionals. By showing at these events, I was extended the opportunity to interview and take professional headshots for various individuals within the College of Business.
                            <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Headshots help create a profile for people, so that they are seen by not just a name, but a face as well.
                                <br>

                            The biggest challenge with gathering this particular material - high-quality photographs - was ensuring that it was conveying the right message. While every photo tells a story, not every story is accurate to reality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since I was the one taking the photos, I had to make sure that I captured every fleeting moment from the right angle and perspective. I had to decide which position I should take, where the focus should be, and what subject to follow.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            I wanted to be able to accurately convey the story behind the photo as easily as possible, and especially looking at it from a marketing/design perspective, this was crucial.

                           A project I worked on during the Internship was creating a video to promote to business students a program offered by the fin-tech company, Broadridge. By directing and filming a video that featured two students who achieved success in regards to their career through the program, we were able to successfully market this program. With the help of my supervisor, Marie, I planned all aspects of the video, including the interview script, location and setup. I also filmed and edited the video with a Canon EOS 70D, a studio tripod, and editing software such as Adobe Premiere.

                        <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                </div>
                    
                        
                    </div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="row gx-5 align-items-center">
                        
                         
                            <div class="mb-2"><i class="bi-chat-center fs-1 text-primary"></i></div>
                                <p>
                                Working on this video was a learning experience. During the editing process, I realized that there was much I should have taken into consideration while shooting the original footage. For example, the interviewees were speaking fast, and this made the transition between the clips choppy and awkward. I solved this issue by slowing down the beginning and end of each clip, and adding a separate transition slide with text in between. Following this method allowed me to create a smooth transition that appeared to be more natural. It also added value to the final video as it prefaced each answer with a prompt.

                            <br>
                            Although I conducted previous interviews, this was the first time I was directing a recorded interview for marketing purposes. The experience taught me more about videography and a valuable lesson about planning during any production process.</p>

                    <div class="row gx-5 align-items-center">
                        
                         <div class="mt-5">

                                <br>
                                <p>After navigating the websites of other business schools, researching modern UI design practices, and collecting media such as photos and videos, I created several prototypes of the current College of Business website, using various tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Figma.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The followed design changes are organized based on different sections of the website.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="mt-5">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/CoB-Page-Header.gif" alt="..." />
                             
                             <p>One of the first changes I proposed was to the page header. The page header, presented first and foremost, determined my initial impression of the website. It featured a photo of a person interacting with a screen, yet it drew confusion upon me, as I could not see the face of that person, nor entirely what was on the screen. It was also narrow and disproportionately cropped. 
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 I appreciate how dynamic and interesting a page header can be when it features movement through the use of videos or moving images - both of which I strived to incorporate. I settled on creating a slideshow of key images that I felt showcased what the Stony Brook University College of Business was all about.</p>
                            
                        </div>
                        
                    <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-2">
                        <div class="p-5 text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-website-3.png" alt="..." />
                    </div>
                </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-1">
                        <div class="p-5">
                            <p>
                            The next section of the page features a row dedicated to a single quote: "Ready to Take the Next Step in Your Business Education?" This seemed to be the perfect follow-up question to the visual and textual information provided in the page header. I made minimal changes, some of which were scaling up the text, and centering the text body and button. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                               I also changed the background to black. Although the graphic displaying red rays was in unision with Stony Brook University's branding, I felt as though it was too bold, especially with its placement being directly underneath a slideshow of vibrant photographs. I wanted to incorporate this graphic element elsewhere.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The next section of the website features the College of Business' graduate programs. I felt as though this row was very plain, and unengaging as it was.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Since I had switched out the background of the previous row with black, it would be unfitting to keep a background of the same color. I opted for a blurred image of an audience at a College of Business event. This background is not plain, however, it is not vibrant or distracting enough to take away from the important information. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I substituted the previous photographs for those of higher-quality and relevance to the subcategories. I also scaled up and shifted the text from atop the images to the bottom to create a balance between the title, subtitle and captions. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                            
                            <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-1">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-website-2.png" alt="..." />
                </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-2">
                            <p>The next section features a row with a handful of statistics from the College of Business. I felt as though the text in this section was not holding my attention: each individual statistic appeared to be just another block of text that I would be straining my eyes to read.        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                                I wanted to make this section more dynamic, by pulling out the numbers from the text block and scaling them to a larger size that can be read in one glance. This draws far more attention because the numbers pull a viewer in and the eyes automatically flow down to the text below. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                                I removed the graphic element of the red rays from the background. The white text on the red background had a great contrast that I felt was also straining to the eye. However, I did not want to take away from the Stony Brook University Brand without replacing it with a similar component. So, I included a blurred background of a landscape photograph of campus featuring a "Far Beyond" flag. The green of the trees contrasts with the red of the university colors, bringing a harmonious balance. 
                                <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                                I also included a photograph of a student promoting a College of Business club during the Involvement Fair. This photo is appropriately placed next to the statistic about business clubs and organizations on campus. Overall, these photographs bring meaning to the section, and instead of writing away these numbers as just another statistic, website visitors will feel more connected.

                            </div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="mt-5">
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-website-1.png" alt="..." />
                             
                             <p> <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                 The next section is a row featuring a Spotlight, News and Updates, and Events.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 It felt counterproductive to lump together a spotlight feature with two list blocks, so I seperated these two sections into top and bottom. This creates a hierachy: the most important news, "the spotlight", would be at the top, followed up with a list of other updates below.
                            <br>
                                 <br>
                            I was inspired by the website of another college at our university, the College of Arts and Sciences, to update the Calendar. The icons and thin text make it more readable, less cluttered, and overall a pleasant experience to scroll through.
                            <br>
                                <br>
                                <br></p>
                            
                            <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/cob-website-4.png" alt="..." />
                             
                             <p>The last section I proposed edits to was the row above the footer. It features a video titled: What the Stony Brook College of Business Can Offer You.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                Although this was a link to another YouTube video, I switched out the thumbnail to a picture of Harriman Hall, where the College of Business is actually located. The previous thumbnail featured a location (the Physics building) which was not relevant to the College of Business. This image will just be a preview and link to the original YouTube video when clicked.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            The original background of this section was a low-quality, grainy image. I decided that this would be a good opportunity to make use of the red rays that are indicative of the Stony Brook Far Beyond Brand, as this is a video specifically dedicated to marketing one of the university's programs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I replaced the buttons linking to Instagram and Twitter with icons and shifted them to the section above, to reduce white space and increase aesthetic appeal.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>This internship helped me gain professional experience with working on a website. I learned more about the things I was passionate about, such as web design, graphic design and photography, and was able to apply this knowledge in the real world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the challenges I faced was being limited by the resources that I had access to. I experienced this while attempting to implement my proposed changes; for example, an image I created for the header wasn't cropped to the right dimensions and would be rejected by the system. I had to use a different approach than I originally planned. As I learned from this obstacle, I still managed to carry out my original vision and it taught me to be flexible with my methods. I learned a lot of practical skills from holding the role of Website Intern, and I was grateful to be able to have this experience.
